# CRAN Cookbook :fork_and_knife:

_Easy recipes to implement & discover for common CRAN submission issues_

Note: This Cookbook is currently in development.


## About

The goals of the project "CRAN Cookbook: Improving the Skills of R Package Maintainers" are:

1. Educate a diverse cohort of young R developers to acquire the technical knowledge and skills required to participate in the continuous integration of R packages into the R ecosystem.
2. Develop a new documentation solution with a Quarto website that is user-friendly for new R package maintainers on CRAN.
3. Identify common CRAN submission issues and create a framework of "problems" and "solutions" that are easy to implement and discover.

The project proposal can be found in the [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/r-devel/cran-cookbook/wiki/Project-Proposal).
