# Missing `\value`-tags in .Rd-files

## Problem

Every .Rd file should have an `\value`-tag stating what the output of the function is. Even if nothing is returned, the `\value`-tag is necessary for CRAN.

## Solution

Often it is enough to simply add the missing `\value`-tags. If the function doesn't return anything, write that as your `\value`-tag.

### Details

CRAN wants a `\value`-tag for every .Rd-file containing info about the structure of the output (class) and also what the output means.

Adding a short explanation for each function helps users understand effects of the function call. This prevents unexpected outputs and helps to create a better workflow when using the function.

The only exception are .Rd-files for data sets, marked with the `\docType{data}`-tag. Since these are no functions, no `\value`-tag is necessary.

Sometimes functions don't return one specific value but are rather called for their side effects. In that case the `\value`-tag should state this.

``` default
\value{No return value, called for side effects}
```

When using 'roxygen' to render the .Rd-files, an `@return`-tag must be added in the corresponding .R-file. This will create the `\value`-tag automatically when rendering.

``` default
#' @return What your function returns.
```

# Repeated Rejections of Issues in Manuals If Using 'roxygen2' {#repeated-rejections-of-issues-in-manuals-if-using-roxygen2}

## Problem

The CRAN team rejected your package for issues regarding the manuals a second time, even if you already changed them according to their suggestions.

## Solution

Implement your changes in the corresponding .R-files instead of the .Rd-files. Before resubmitting render the .Rd-files again using `roxygenize()`.

### Details

If you decide to render your manuals with ['roxygen2'](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/index.html), the .Rd-files can be render using the function [`roxygenize()`](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/reference/roxygenize.html). If changes are implemented directly in the .Rd-file, they will be overwritten during the next render. Similarly, changes in the 'roxygen2'-section of .R-files will not transfer to the .Rd-files without a re-rendering.

::: callout-tip
To avoid this mistake, make sure to **always** call `roxygenize()` before submitting your package.

If you want to know more on how to use 'roxygen2' to create your manuals, take a look at their [website](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/index.html).

::: callout-note
When using 'devtools', the function [`devtools::document()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/devtools/versions/2.4.5/topics/document) acts as a wrapper for `roxygenize()` and can be used to render the .Rd-files.

# Overall Checktime

## Problem

Automatic CRAN tests give a NOTE saying the overall checktime of your package is too long.

## Solution 

Reduce the length and quantity of your examples, vignettes and tests.

### Details

::: {.callout-note title="CRAN NOTE" icon=false}

Check: Overall checktime, Result: NOTE
&emsp; Overall checktime 20 min > 10 min

  
:::


CRAN tests the unwrapped examples, vignettes and tests of packages rather frequently. The overall time it takes to run all of them should therefore be less than 10 minutes in total. 

This should not discourage from writing extensive test and documentation with high code coverage but rather encourage sensible testing. Avoid vignettes or test with many it iterations, run them on small toy data or provide precomputed results.
