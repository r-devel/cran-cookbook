It is designed\n    to flexibly parse many types of data found in the wild, while still\n    cleanly failing when data unexpectedly changes.\n```\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n# Explaining Acronyms\n\n## Problem\n\nYou are using acronyms in your DESCRIPTION file or they are flagged by the automatic spell check.\n\n## Solution\n\nDocument all non-obvious acronyms in the [cran-comments.md](https://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/use_cran_comments.html) file to facilitate the CRAN team review.\n\n### Details\n\nMost acronyms that are not widely known should be explained. For example, you don’t have to explain *OLS*, *SEO*, or *DNA* but explanations should be provided for: *MEFM* or *OCCDS*. If you are unsure of the acronyms common knowledge, please document all acronyms in the package.\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n# LICENSE files\n\n## Problem\n\nSome licenses do not need to be added verbatim, instead they are referenced in the DESCRIPTION file and the CRAN template is added to the package. You can find the template at the [CRAN website](https://cran.r-project.org/web/licenses/).\n\n## Solution\n\nRemove the reference `+ file LICENSE` and delete the LICENSE file.\n\n### Details\n\nMost licenses don’t need an additional file as these are part of R. The list of which licenses that do require an additional file can be accessed within _R_ by searching for **Note: this is a template, needs + file LICENSE**:\n\n```r\npath_licenses <- list.files(path = R.home(), \"license.db\", full.names = TRUE, recursive = TRUE)\nlicenses_doc <- as.data.frame(read.dcf(path_licenses))\n```\n\nIf an additional file is needed, it should only specify the **author** and **year** for a MIT file or **year**, **copyright holder**, and **organization** for a BSD file. \n\n::: callout-tip\n## Tip\n\nLicenses should be FOSS, or allowed by [R](https://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk/share/licenses/license.db). \n\n:::\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Title Case\n\n## Problem\n\nThe package Title field in the DESCRIPTION file is not in Title Case and the first letter of some or all of the words in the title are lowercase.\n\n## Solution\n\nThe package Title field in the DESCRIPTION file must be in Title Case, except words like \"a\", \"the\" or \"of\".\n\n### Details\n\nDetermining Title Case automatically can be challenging due to word significance being only known by the package author. The function `toTitleCase()` can assist with transforming sentences into Title Case from the 'tools' package.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntools::toTitleCase(\"web application framework for R\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"Web Application Framework for R\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: callout-note\nThere are some exceptions to using Title Case for quoting longer works like book titles and shorter works like [research papers](https://www.scribbr.com/academic-writing/title-case/#:~:text=In%20title%20case%2C%20the%20first,title%2C%20subtitle%2C%20or%20heading.). \n\nIt is also not recommended to [mention package names](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-devel/R-exts.html#The-DESCRIPTION-file) in the Title.\n:::\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Using Authors@R\n\n\n## Problem\n\nYou have not properly declared the authors, maintainers and copyright holders in the `Authors@R` section of the DESCRIPTION file.\n\n## Solution\n\nAdd the `Authors@R` field in the DESCRIPTION file. \n\n\n### Details\n\nYou can find more roles in the help documentation by running `?utils::person`. Make sure the provided email address is actively monitored, as it will be the primary point of contact with CRAN for future updates and fixes.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nAuthors@R: person(\"Jane\", \"Smith\", email = \"chef@cran-cookbook.com\",\n  role = c(\"aut\", \"cre\"), ORCID = \"<USER-ORCID>\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n::: callout-note\n\nThe Maintainer and Author fields are automatically generated, so you don't need to add them manually.\n\nIf your package uses the older approach of specifying Maintainer and Author separately in the DESCRIPTION file, it won’t be rejected for that reason alone. However, this method is discouraged, and any manual modifications that differ from the auto-generated fields will result in automatic rejection by CRAN.\n\n:::\n",
