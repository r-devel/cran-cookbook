    "text": "Quick Start\nThis is a Quarto website.\nTo learn more about Quarto websites visit https://quarto.org/docs/websites.\n\n\nIntroduction\nThe CRAN Cookbook has been developed as part of a special project grant from the R Consortium in 2024. The proposal is titled: Improving the Skills of R Package Maintainers. The goals of the project are:\n\nEducate a diverse cohort of young R developers to acquire the technical knowledge and skills required to participate in the continuous integration of R packages into the R ecosystem.\nDevelop a new documentation solution with a Quarto website that is user-friendly for new R package maintainers on CRAN.\nIdentify common CRAN submission issues and create a framework of “problems” and “solutions” that are easy to implement and discover.\n\n\n\nPrerequisites\n\n\nAdditional Resources\n\nWriting R Extensions\nCRAN Repository Policy"
