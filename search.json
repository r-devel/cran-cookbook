The goals of the project are:\n\nEducate a diverse cohort of young R developers to acquire the technical knowledge and skills required to participate in the continuous integration of R packages into the R ecosystem.\nDevelop a new documentation solution with a Quarto website that is user-friendly for new R package maintainers on CRAN.\nIdentify common CRAN submission issues and create a framework of “problems” and “solutions” that are easy to implement and discover.\n\n\n\nPrerequisites\n\n\nAdditional Resources\n\nWriting R Extensions\nCRAN Repository Policy\nChecklist for CRAN submissions",

However, this output must be suppressable by users.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nPrinting in special functions like print, summary, interactive functions or methods for generic functions is accepted.\n\n\nTo allow users to suppress the console output CRAN recommends two different ways:\n\nexchanging cat()/print() with other generics\n\nmessage(): for information messages and status updates\nwarning(): for warning, will print a “Warning:” before the output\nstop(): for error messages, will print an “Error:” before the output and halt the execution\n\n\nThis allows to use functions like suppressMessages() to avoid unwanted output.\n\nusing an additional function argument\n\ncreate one argument in your function to turn off the console output\nCRAN suggests using verbose, other names are accepted\n\n\nThis example code shows the use of a verbose argument to allow users to suppress printing\n\nfoo &lt;- function(..., verbose = TRUE){\n  # your code\n  if(verbose){\n    print(\"Whatever you want to say!\")\n  }\n  # your code\n}\n\nFunctions can print per default, like the example above, as long as the printing can be turned off (here, by setting verbose = FALSE).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nprint() and cat() are not the only functions which can write output onto the console.

    "text": "Solution\nReset the changed options, in your functions by using on.exit() or in examples, demos and vignettes with an additional line of code after the example.\n\nDetails\nIdeally, the user’s options are not changed at all. If they really have to be altered, restoring the previous values of user options is mandatory for CRAN packages. The reason for this rule is this line stated in the CRAN Repository Policy:\n\nThe code and examples provided in a package should never do anything which might be regarded as malicious or anti-social.\n\nResetting options is therefore mainly a Quality-of-Life feature for users of your package.\nThere are different ways of resetting for functions, and examples, demos or vignettes which are recommended by CRAN.\nChanging par(), options() or setwd() all invisibly return the previous values and therefore these can be stored in variables using the assignment operator &lt;- and later be restored by calling the variable name as argument in the respective function.\nFor functions:\nWhen changing options inside one of your package functions, you can use on.exit() for restoring.\n\nfoo &lt;- function(x){\n  \n  # par():\n  oldpar &lt;- par(mfrow = c(2,2))\n  on.exit(par(oldpar))\n  \n  # options():\n  oldop &lt;- options(digits = 3)\n  on.exit(options(oldop))\n  \n  # setwd():\n  oldwd &lt;- setwd(\".\")\n  on.exit(setwd(oldwd))\n  \n  # your code which requires a changed option\n  \n}\n\nThis will reset the par(), options() and setwd(). The use of on.exit() makes it possible to restore options before exiting a function even if the function breaks. Therefore it needs to be called immediately after the option change within a function. For more information, call ?on.exit() in your console.\nFor demos, examples and vignettes: Since no function is exited when changing options in examples, on.exit() cannot be used. CRAN recommends the following way for restoring options:\n\noldpar &lt;- par(mfrow = c(2,2))\n\n# your code which requires a changed option\n\npar(oldpar)\n\nHere the code will only reset the options if the example runs without breaking. Therefore, try to keep the code between setting and resetting as concise as possible. Restoring the options() and setwd() can be done using the same principle as for par() shown above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf you need to change more than one option in the same function, example, vignette or demo, you can use oldpar &lt;- par(no.readonly = TRUE) or oldop &lt;- options() to reset all parameters at once. Saving the entire Note, that for par() the no.readonly argument must be set to TRUE or else warnings will be produced.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe issue described in the recipe, also applies to the use of other function which change some parameters persistently, like Sys.setLanguage.",

Therefore, CRAN has several wrappers to structure them. The following list gives a short overview of the most common ones and when to use them.\n\nUnwrapper:\n\nShort examples to show the functionality of the code\nCRAN recommends the use of toy examples on small data sets\nIdeally, also cover some edge cases\n\n\\donttest{}:\n\nLengthy examples, with execution times longer than 5 seconds\nExamples that download data\nThey are tested infrequently on CRAN as well and are also executed when calling example()\n\n\\dontrun{}:\n\nUnexecutable examples due to missing information (e.g. API calls where a password is needed)\nExamples which require additional software\nNever executed, are automatically marked with a comment (“# Not run:”) in the Help file.\n\nif(interactive){}:\n\nFunctions which only run interactively and cannot be used in scripts\nMost commonly, examples for Shiny Apps and interactive plots\n\ntry():\n\nExamples which are supposed to fail and throw an error\ntry() shows the error message but won’t halt the execution\n\nif(requireNamespace(“packagename”)){}\n\nUsed for examples which need particular packages to run\nThose packages should be listed in the Suggests filed of the DESCRIPTION file\n\n\\dontshow{}:\n\nTreated similarly to unwrapped examples but are not shown to the user\nGreat for setting and resetting options or code purely for tests\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nAll wrappers must still be placed inside the \\examples{} tag.",
