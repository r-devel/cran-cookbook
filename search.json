    "text": "Solution\nReset the changed options, in your functions by using on.exit() or in examples, demos and vignettes with an additional line of code after the example.\n\nDetails\nIdeally, the user’s options are not changed at all. If they really have to be altered, restoring the previous values of user options is mandatory for CRAN packages. The reason for this rule is this line stated in the CRAN Repository Policy:\n\nThe code and examples provided in a package should never do anything which might be regarded as malicious or anti-social.\n\nResetting options is therefore mainly a Quality-of-Life feature for users of your package.\nThere are different ways of resetting for functions, and examples, demos or vignettes which are recommended by CRAN.\nChanging par(), options() or setwd() all invisibly return the previous values and therefore these can be stored in variables using the assignment operator &lt;- and later be restored by calling the variable name as argument in the respective function.\nFor functions:\nWhen changing options inside one of your package functions, you can use on.exit() for restoring.\n\nfoo &lt;- function(x){\n  \n  # par():\n  oldpar &lt;- par(mfrow = c(2,2))\n  on.exit(par(oldpar))\n  \n  # options():\n  oldop &lt;- options(digits = 3)\n  on.exit(options(oldop))\n  \n  # setwd():\n  oldwd &lt;- setwd(\".\")\n  on.exit(setwd(oldwd))\n  \n  # your code which requires a changed option\n  \n}\n\nThis will reset the par(), options() and setwd(). The use of on.exit() makes it possible to restore options before exiting a function even if the function breaks. Therefore it needs to be called immediately after the option change within a function. For more information, call ?on.exit() in your console.\nFor demos, examples and vignettes: Since no function is exited when changing options in examples, on.exit() cannot be used. CRAN recommends the following way for restoring options:\n\noldpar &lt;- par(mfrow = c(2,2))\n\n# your code which requires a changed option\n\npar(oldpar)\n\nHere the code will only reset the options if the example runs without breaking. Therefore, try to keep the code between setting and resetting as concise as possible. Restoring the options() and setwd() can be done using the same principle as for par() shown above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf you need to change more than one option in the same function, example, vignette or demo, you can use oldpar &lt;- par(no.readonly = TRUE) or oldop &lt;- options() to reset all parameters at once. Saving the entire Note, that for par() the no.readonly argument must be set to TRUE or else warnings will be produced.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe issue described in the recipe, also applies to the use of other function which change some parameters persistently, like Sys.setLanguage.",

These references should be formatted as shown in the ‘Rcpp’ package:\nDescription: The 'Rcpp' package provides R functions as well as C++ classes which\n offer a seamless integration of R and C++. Many R data types and objects can be\n mapped back and forth to C++ equivalents which facilitates both writing of new\n code as well as easier integration of third-party libraries.
